                <h2>Gaming</h2>
                <p>Another favourite activity of mine is gaming. I used to play games on consoles since I was young. If you are a gaming enthousiast as me, you know that having friends over, gather all around the console, and either compete or work together to achieve a common goal, is one of the greatest feelings. If you are not an enthousiast, then you might understand the appeal of this.</p>
                <p>As the years passed I tried to combine that passion for gaming with my profession. This has lead me in the great discovery of <b>serious gaming</b>. You might be thinking that serious gaming is taking part in competitions or having gaming as a profession, but actually serious games are games that try to achieve something more than just entertainment. The serious games I am working with now aim to help the recovery of patients after major illness or accidents.</p>

                <h2>Top Favourite Games</h2>
                <p>Even thought I am focusing in serious games, that doesn't mean that I stopped playing videogames. There are two types on videogames I enjoy the most. MMORPG (MAssive Multiplayer Online RolePlay Game) and open world 3rd person shooter games.</p>
                <p>My top favourite titles:</p>
